        <p>Have you ever thought why similar companies with similar resources available sometimes achieve very different results?</p>
        <p>While there is no clear answer to this question, more and more executives around the world believe that company culture might be one of the key elements to make a difference.</p>
        <p>If you want to attract top talents, make them stay long in your company, enable them to do right decisions based on the context, keep them happy and productive and as a result be ahead of competition - company culture is very important for you.</p>
